**BEWARE: YOU NEED THE API SOURCE IN ORDER FOR THIS API BACKEND TO WORK.**

# siongTime API

siongTime API is the backend for the [siongTime tvOS app](https://github.com/siong1987/siongTime-tvos).
The API basically returns TVML that can be displayed on the tvOS app.

The API will download a movie from a torrent source and stream it directly to the
tvOS app.

## Notes

- Most javascript files are from Apple's example project.
- If you are interested in how this app works, you should look under
  `routes` and `views` directories.
- You need to provide a source API for this API backend to consume in
  order for this API backend to work. Without it, this API backend will
  not work.
